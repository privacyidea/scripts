This script is supposed to be called after a token is created.
It then creates remote tokens for a list of users, these remote tokens then point to the just created token.
This script is ment to be called by the ScriptEvent handler.

 
   create-remote-tokens.py --serial  <serial number> 
    
You can place the script in your scripts directory /etc/privacyidea/scripts/
and use it in the script event handler.

Configure your script handler like:

event: token_init
position: Post
conditions: 
 * tokentype
action:
 * background: background
 * serial: True
 * sync_to_database: True
 
Adapt it (like the USERNAMES) to your needs.
