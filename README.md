# Script snippets for the Script Event Handler

This repository contains script snippets that give you an idea
how scripts can look like, that can be used with the 
[privacyIDEA Script Event Handler](https://privacyidea.readthedocs.io/en/latest/eventhandler/scripthandler.html).

The scripts in the subdirectory ``toolbox/`` are not ment to be used with event handlers but are
ment to run standalone.

**Note: These scripts are ment as example and not to be used directly, unmodified!**

**Use at your own risk!**
